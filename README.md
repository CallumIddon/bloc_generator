# flutter_bloc_generator

flutter_bloc_generator is a combination of two packages
[flutter_bloc](https://github.com/CallumIddon/flutter_bloc_generator/tree/master/flutter_bloc) and
[flutter_bloc_generator](
https://github.com/CallumIddon/flutter_bloc_generator/tree/master/flutter_bloc_generator).

`flutter_bloc` contains the annotations and `Service` abstract class for creating the input code for
`flutter_bloc_generator`.

`flutter_bloc_generator` is a dart builder that will convert the annotations into the nessecary
classes.

Each package has its own documentation in its README.
