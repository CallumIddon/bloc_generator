# bloc_generator

bloc_generator is a combination of three packages
[bloc_annotations](
https://github.com/CallumIddon/bloc_generator/tree/master/flutter_bloc_annotations),
[bloc_generator](
https://github.com/CallumIddon/bloc_generator/tree/master/flutter_bloc_generator) and
[flutter_bloc_provider](
https://github.com/CallumIddon/bloc_generator/tree/master/flutter_bloc_provider).

`bloc_annotations` contains the annotations and `Service` abstract classes for annotating
your apps code. `bloc_generator` uses the annotations to generate the BLoCs and
`flutter_bloc_provider` contains flutter widgets for providing the BLoC to Flutter apps.

Each package has its own documentation in its README.
