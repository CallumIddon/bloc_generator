# flutter_bloc_generator

flutter_bloc_generator is a combination of two packages
[flutter_bloc_annotations](
https://github.com/CallumIddon/flutter_bloc_generator/tree/master/flutter_bloc_annotations) and
[flutter_bloc_generator](
https://github.com/CallumIddon/flutter_bloc_generator/tree/master/flutter_bloc_generator).

`flutter_bloc_annotations` contains the annotations and `Service` abstract class for creating the input code for
`flutter_bloc_generator`.

classes.

Each package has its own documentation in its README.
